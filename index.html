        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        <p>
            Culturally, coffee is a major part of Ethiopian and Yemenite history. This cultural significance dates
            back as many as 14 centuries, which is when coffee was (or was not) discovered in Yemen . Whether coffee
            was first used in Ethiopia or Yemen is a topic of debate and each country has its own myths, legends,
            and facts about the beverage's origin.Coffee grown worldwide can trace its
            heritage backcenturies to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. ... The story goes that
            that Kaldi
            discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became
            so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. coffee was cultivated long before tea! Coffee was
            considered an established crop by the turn of the 19th century and exported to Europe. By the early
            1940s, Indian Arabica Coffee was well known throughout the
            European market, although was often referred to as Mysore Coffee at the time. Coffee production in India
            dominates the South Indian states and is said to be the finest coffee grown in the shade rather than the
            sunlight anywhere in the world.
